## DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE, IT IS A TEMPLATE. THAT YOU NEED TO COPY
# Prusa MK3s Klipper Config

# The first thing you'll need to do is go through this file and comment out / uncomment 
# the files and/or settings you need.

# You'll be able to print just fine with this config as it is, but it is recommended
# that you follow these steps to properly calibrate your printer:

# 0) Sanity check and PID Tuning: https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_checks.html
# 1) Pressure Advance: https://www.klipper3d.org/Pressure_Advance.html
# 2) Skew Correction: https://www.klipper3d.org/skew_correction.html
# 3) Resonance Compensation: https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html

# To tune Pressure Advance see https://www.klipper3d.org/Pressure_Advance.html
# default is already set based on hotend, but you can further improve prints by calibrating it to your nozzle and material
# pressure_advance: 0.05
nozzle_diameter: 0.4 # Remember to change this if you change nozzle diameter.

## copy this from your current setting on Prusa, but make it absolute (removing -)

## For faster printing enable
